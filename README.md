# kriya-Robosoccer-2019

During the techfest organized by PSG College of technology in Coimbatore, I participated in the Robosoccer event. Our team was tasked with designing and building a differential drive robot with a paddle mechanism that could dribble the ball and shoot at the goal post.

In this repository, you will find all the code and documentation related to our robot's design and implementation. Our goal was to create a highly efficient and effective robot that could outperform our competitors in the event.

The repository includes detailed information about the hardware and software components used in our robot, along with the programming languages and tools we used to develop the code. We also have included a section on the strategies and techniques we used to train our robot to dribble and shoot accurately.
